```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install cmake
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you get errors with `dlib`, make sure CMake and Visual Studio Build Tools are installed and in your PATH.

### 8. **MongoDB Atlas Setup**
- Create a free cluster at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
- Whitelist your IP and get your connection string.
- Update `MONGO_URI` in `app.py` with your connection string.

## Troubleshooting
- **dlib install errors:**
  - Ensure CMake and Visual Studio Build Tools are installed and in your PATH.
